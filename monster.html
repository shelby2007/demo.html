    <i> aside from nihilism are heavily emphasized within Johan's character, he's oozing charisma, and many people find
        him attractive. Throughout the series, there are many who describe Johan as "pretty" or "beautiful." Even when
        he dressed as his sister to sneak around the city, many people notice his natural beauty. While Johan never says

        so he can get what he wants -- usually some form of des'truction or chaos.
